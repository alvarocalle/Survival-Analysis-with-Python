These SQL scripts allow you to calculate the annual failure rate
for Q3 2016 for disk drives from the published CSV files.

First change your starting directory to the location of the sql files and the 2016 directory/folder.

Then use these commands to reproduce the results:

    $ sqlite3 drive_stats.db
    sqlite> .read create_table_Q3_2016.sql
    sqlite> .read import_Q3_2016.sql
    sqlite> .read stats_Q3_2016.sql
    sqlite> .mode columns
    sqlite> select * from failure_rates order by model;
